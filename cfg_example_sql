#  /usr/home		# Declare /usr/home as an empty path,
#  !/usr/home		# for masks to work.
#  d~public_html
#  /var
#  d!var/log
#  f~netconf\.log.*
#
#  only /usr/home/*/public_html will be added to the archive,
#  and the files in /var/log/var/log/, except for messages, will not.
#  But, /usr/local/home/user/public_html will be added to the
#  archive will not be ! To search by masks only, you need to declare:
#  /
#  !/
#  d~public_html
#  d~cgi-bin
